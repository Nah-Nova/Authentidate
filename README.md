## Introduction

Welcome to the Authentidate Mobile App Project! This project is a part of the A2D2 en B2C4 course - Mobile Applications in PI4, and it's a solo project undertaken as part of your coursework.

## Project Overview

### Assignment Description

The objective of this project is to develop a mobile application with a primary focus on user interaction and the application of various features provided by the Maui framework. The app aims to provide a dating experience that prioritizes authenticity and genuine connections among users. While functionality is important, the emphasis is on exploring and applying the capabilities of Maui.

### Project Choice

For this assignment, I have chosen Option 3: "App for singles (dating app) that introduces people to each other based on a quiz." The goal is to create a dating app that goes beyond swiping profiles and instead matches users based on their responses to a personalized quiz. Users can create their quizzes to share with others, fostering authentic connections.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication and registration.
- **Quiz-Based Matching**: Allow users to answer quizzes to determine compatibility with others.
- **Profile Creation**: Enable users to create detailed profiles with photos and interests.
- **Custom Quizzes**: Let users create and share their quizzes for matchmaking.
- **Secure Messaging**: Implement private messaging between matched users.
- **User Privacy**: Provide control over profile visibility and privacy settings.
- **Reporting and Blocking**: Include features for reporting and blocking inappropriate users.
- **Community Standards**: Enforce clear guidelines for respectful interactions.
- **User Reviews**: Allow ratings and reviews for user interactions.
- **Safety Measures**: Implement identity verification and safety features.
- **User-Centered Design**: Place an emphasis on user experience and interface design.
